## About me

Hi! I'm a programmer since 2022! I'm available for hire for your projects, so feel free to DM me and invite me to them, but not for free!

> [!NOTE]
> I'm not talking about employment, I don't have a college degree!

## My languages

### Haxe

My first and main language, which I still use.

Over the years I have used the following frameworks:
- [Heaps](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps)
- [Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha)
- [OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl/openfl)
- [Flixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel)

### C++

I haven't used it much yet, so my maximum is externs for Haxe!
